Experiment Description	Whole exome sequencing data was produced and analyzed by Baylor Human Genome Sequencing Center as part of the TCGA effort towards comprehensive genomic characterization of multiple tumor types.  Massively parallel sequencing exome capture was performed on untreated papillary renal cell carcinoma samples using NimbleGen (custom designed) arrays according the manufacturer’s instructions. All exome sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq platforms. Basic alignment and initial sequence analysis were carried out using the Mercury analysis pipeline.

Protocol Type														
Protocol Description	Libraries were constructed into Illumina paired end pre capture libraries according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina Multiplexing_SamplePrep_Guide_1005361_D) using Phusion DNA polymerase with modifications. Libraries were prepared using Beckman robotic workstations (Biomek FX and FXp models).  The complete protocol and oligonucleotide sequences are accessible from the HGSC website https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Illumina_Barcoded_Paired-End_Capture_Library_Preparation_Using_Non-index_Adaptors_and_Phusion_DNA_Polymerase.pdf	Libraries were constructed into Illumina paired-end pre-capture libraries according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina Multiplexing_SamplePrep_Guide_1005361_D) using KAPA DNA polymerase with modifications.
